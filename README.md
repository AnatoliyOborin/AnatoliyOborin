# I am a beginner developer in C# programming language

### About me
I have been studying the C # programming language quite recently. At this time, I am familiar with the console
development platform and learn the basics of this language. I am interested in developing and studying other 
development platforms, as well as supplementing my knowledge of algorithms, data structures, design patterns (to improve the code) and actively apply them in practice.
